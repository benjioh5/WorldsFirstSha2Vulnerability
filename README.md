# WorldsFirstSha2Vulnerability
Sha256 vulnerability for full rounds. A Circular hash attack(known as fixed point).

# Proof
Run proof.py to check my work

# Concepts
## Free-start collision attack
A collision attack where hackers cannot control the input hash.
## Circular hash attack
Finding input_hash and message_block which makes input_hash=output_hash.
In certain cases, it can result infinite set of collisions by chaining arbitrary number of circular blocks. So, this attack makes one hash value permanently vulnerable to collisions. So, I decided not to publish another works.
# Attack methods
I developed an entirely new type of cryptanalysis theory to achieve this. It has a similar form comparing to differential analysis.
Individuals found ways to reproduce this vulnerbility using SAT software. It's an another approach, not done by my method.

# Clarifications
I've been noticed by several individuals, thus 'circular hash attack' isn't the world's first type of attack. So, I fixed the description. Quiet sad :(

Some people told me it's easy to find fixed points for Davies-Meyer structure, so, it's easy to find circular hash of SHA256's. 
For it, I cannot clarify at some degrees. First, SHA256's not exactly a Davies-Meyer. Secondly, finding fixed points for such structures, claimed to be 'easy', has complexity above 2^(n/2), according to Wikipedia. It's still an infeasibly hard problem.
