# WorldsFirstSha2Vulnerability
Sha256 vulnerability for full rounds. Free-start collision attack + circular hash attack(new type of hash attack).

# Proof
Run proof.py to check my work

# Concepts
## Free-start collision attack
A collision attack where hackers cannot control the input hash.
## Circular hash attack
Finding input_hash and message_block which makes input_hash=output_hash.
In certain cases, it can result infinite set of collisions by chaining arbitrary number of circular blocks. So, this attack makes one hash value permanently vulnerable to collisions. So, I decided not to publish another works.
# Attack methods
I developed an entirely new type of cryptanalysis theory to achieve this.
It has a similar form comparing to differential analysis.
