# WorldsFirstSha2Vulnerability
Sha256 vulnerability for full rounds. Free-start collision attack + circular hash attack(new type of hash attack).

# Proof
run proof.py to check

# Concepts
Free-start collision attack: a collision attack which hackers cannot control the input hash.

Circular hash attack: finding input_hash and message_block which makes input_hash=output_hash. In certain cases, it can result infinite set of collisions by chaining arbitrary number of circular blocks.
# Details
I developed an entirely new type of cryptanalysis theory to achieve this.
